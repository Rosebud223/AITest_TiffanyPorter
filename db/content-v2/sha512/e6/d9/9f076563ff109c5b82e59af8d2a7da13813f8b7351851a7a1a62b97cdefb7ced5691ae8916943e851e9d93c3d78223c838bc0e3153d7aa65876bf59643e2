Instead of\r\nworking with the `MeshFilter.sharedMesh` you'll instead be operating on the\r\nProBuilder representation of the mesh: `ProBuilderMesh`.\r\n\r\nA typical workflow looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Create a new cube primitive\r\nvar mesh = ShapeGenerator.CreateShape(ShapeType.Cube);\r\n\r\n// Extrude the first available face along it's normal direction by 1 meter.\r\nmesh.Extrude(new Face[] { mesh.faces.First() }, ExtrudeMethod.FaceNormal, 1f);\r\n\r\n// Apply the changes back to the `MeshFilter.sharedMesh`.\r\n// 1. ToMesh cleans the UnityEngine.Mesh and assigns vertices and sub-meshes.\r\n// 2. Refresh rebuilds generated mesh data, ie UVs, Tangents, Normals, etc.\r\n// 3. (Optional, Editor only) Optimize merges coincident vertices, and rebuilds lightmap UVs.\r\nmesh.ToMesh();\r\nmesh.Refresh();\r\nmesh.Optimize();\r\n```\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[Unity Companion License](LICENSE.md)\r\n\r\n## Third Party Licenses<a name=\"third-party-licenses\"></a>\r\n\r\n[Third Party Licenses](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.probuilder/blob/master/com.unity.probuilder/Third%20Party%20Notices.md)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n**All contributions are subject to the [Unity Contribution Agreement(UCA)](https://unity3d.com/legal/licenses/Unity_Contribution_Agreement).**\r\n\r\nBy making a pull request, you are confirming agreement to the terms and conditions of the UCA, including that your Contributions are your original creation and that you have complete right and authority to make your Contributions.\r\n\r\n**Pull Requests**\r\n\r\nPlease include an entry to the changelog for any PR, along with a Fogbugz ticket number if applicable.\r\n\r\nNew logs should be placed under the `## [Unreleased]` header at the top of the changelog.
