In particular, the software takes in a set of representative high-quality mesh shapes and poses, and trains a machine-learning model to learn how to deform and skin the mesh. ZivaRT allows for film-quality characters to be deployed in real-time applications.\n\n","dependencies":{"com.unity.burst":"1.8.4","com.unity.mathematics":"1.2.6","com.unity.modules.animation":"1.0.0"},"relatedPackages":{"com.unity.zivart-player.tests":"2.1.0"},"_upm":{"changelog":"### Added\n- Add GPU profiling markers to Compute Shader implementation\n- Add analytics for tracking the number of scalars being used\n- Add support for non-skinned meshes when using the runtime API\n- Add an API to load ZivaRT assets at runtime\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix public API documentation.\n- Fix documentation link to CHANGELOG"},"upmCi":{"footprint":"c84d8a641da406337e3c23556b3f8b6fa10c807e"},"documentationUrl":"https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.zivart-player@2.1/manual/index.html","repository":{"url":"https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.zivart-player.git","type":"git","revision":"6c3b26a50c74bb6e6bfbbc6be380e1164f5e4637"},"samples":[{"displayName":"ZivaRT Samples","description":"ZivaRT Runtime Examples.","path":"Samples~"}],"dist":{"shasum":"c6db5a8fbce77390954202bf087efe0feccffedf"}}
