It'll defer it to `Update()` if the component is disabled.\n- Components will now appear under the `Other/MonoBehaviours` search menu for variable types (adding new variables, or setting them for node variables).\n- Updated AppUI to 2.0.0-pre.16 to benefit from fixes to AppUI.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue where existing subgraph representations would not sometimes be removed when deleting the text input.\n- Static subgraphs now have their parent rebuilt when saved.\n- Fixed regression where renaming a blackboard variable would not be reflected in the graph.\n- Calling `BehaviorGraphAgent.Restart()` before the graph was started resulted in the graph's `Start()` being called twice.\n- Fixed search view string formatting leaking through to the callers such as type dropdowns.\n- Fixed an issue where case differences in the case of variable names on the subgraph representation could cause duplicate fields added on a `SubgraphNodeModel`.\n- Opening a behavior graph window wasn't focusing the window when docked, causing it to be behind other windows.\n- Graph agent init and start states weren't set correctly after runtime deserialization.\n- `Restart()` was running first iteration of the graph even when the agent was paused.\n- Fixed behavior graph not always framing the graph content correctly when opening a Behavior Graph asset.\n- Fixed attempting to assign a GameObject to a newly created GameObject Blackboard Variable in the Blackboard inspector not working.\n- Fixed an issue where Run Subgraph node LinkFields would not keep their override values correctly when the Subgraph Representation mode was toggled on.\n- Fixed an issue where duplicated Run Subgraph nodes did not keep their Subgraph Representation mode selected for the node UI.\n- Right Click -> Edit/Inspect Script will now work correctly with VSCode.\n- Fixed warning when changing a BlackboardVariable type to Vector2Int or Vector3Int.\n- Fixed search filter formatting persisting when using the back button to return to the search root.\n- Improved search query result accuracy.\n- Overriding 'Self' variable works again, allowing you to use a different GameObject to the one running the graph.\n- `NavigateToTargetAction` will correctly return success instead of failure if it's started within range of the target.\n- Fixed an issue where fields on duplicated nodes did not keep the correct local values from the original.\n- Sequencing/Enum Wizards will no longer propose the same enum/port name as one that already exists (example, adding 2 members with default name, deleting the 1st one and adding a new one used to call both Member 2).\n- Fixed BlackboardAsset Shared Variable keeping playmode value.\n- Run Subgraph (Dynamic) wasn't initializing a copy of the graph asset correctly, causing data to be shared amongst agents sharing the graph and corrupting the graph asset.\n- Various `SetBlackboardVariable` APIs were writing to the asset incorrectly before it was initialized.\n- Changing the value of a subgraph blackboard variable to a different subgraph will now correctly update the dynamic subgraph node running it.\n- Subgraph variables will correctly sync with the parent graph and vice versa.\n\n### Known Issues\n- After much user feedback and investigation, we have determined that runtime serialization is not recommended for use at this time due to an existing limitation in its implementation. Our team is working diligently to address these concerns and bring the feature to the expected quality level in an upcoming release. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience and understanding as we strive to enhance this functionality.\n- After using the \"Delete Runtime Assets\" button for the graph, prefabs/objects using the graph may lose their references to it (or contain an old stale one) and need reassignment."},"unity":"6000.0","samples":[{"path":"Samples~/Example","description":"A simple Behavior example.","displayName":"Unity Behavior Example"},{"path":"Samples~/Serialization","description":"A small example showing how to serialize and deserialize the active state of a behavior tree at runtime.","displayName":"Runtime Serialization"}],"unityRelease":"16f1","documentationUrl":"https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.behavior@1.0/manual/index.html","name":"com.unity.behavior","version":"1.0.8","displayName":"Behavior","description":"Unity Behavior is a graph-based tool to create and run behavior trees.

Added demonstation sample.\n- Allow using `TooltipAttribute` on BlackboardVariables to display a tooltip.\n- Can now right click on a Blackboard Variable to copy its GUID.\n- Can now right click on a Blackboard Variable to copy its GUID.\n- Inspector will now display an inspection of the behavior graph, when nothing else is being selected.\n- The Story button on the editor toolbar has been removed, and the graph's subgraph representation can now be edited through the Inspector.\n- Transform Blackboard Variable type to the default blackboard options.\n- Can add Blackboard references to graphs.\n- Shared variables that are shared between instances of the same graph.\n- Run Subgraph node combines now two nodes, a static Run Subgraph and the new Run Subgraph Dynamic, which can be used to run graphs dynamically on runtime.\n- Subgraph variables can now be added on the Blackboard.\n- Adds new built-in nodes\n- Transform Blackboard Variable type to the default blackboard options.\n-

Blackboard, Node Wizard and Condition Wizard now use a search window for variables.\n- Removed variable icons.\n- Creation wizards fields will be automatically focused when shown.\n- Replaced icons for behavior graph agent and the graph asset with new designs.\n- Updated node filenames and class names to have appropriate postfixes.\n- Replaced all mouse events & usages to pointer events.\n- Updated MoveToLocation and MoveToTarget logic for slowing down as target reached to use a distance from target instead of Min(Speed, Distance);\n- Updated blackboard variable field assignment to support implicit casting between GameObject and components, components and GameObjects as well as components of different types.\n- Moved existing built-in nodes to package namespace\n- Updated built-in nodes categories\n- Merged Repeat nodes into a single node.\n- Merged Run in Parallel nodes into a single node.\n- Updated all tutorial images to be JPEG intead of PNG for a significant memory saving.\n- Start node repeat field is no longer a link field.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Disabled inspector buttons for editing the definitions of built-in nodes.\n- Inspector showing buttons for editing the definitions of built-in nodes.\n- Fixed custom node definition editing not cleaning up existing properties.\n- Crashes on Domain reload caused by OnAssetsSave().\n- Performance when dragging nodes around a graph.\n- Fixed newly created Conditions not being automatically added to the selected Conditional node.\n- Fixed RepeatWhile node behaving like a do while.\n- Conditions not getting copied properly when a conditional node was duplicated.\n- Fixed navigation nodes sometimes stalling after being called successively.\n- Fixed click events going through to elements underneath search menu items.\n- Sequence insertion indicator didn't render at the correct width when dragging a node on top of a node then moving the mouse ontop of another node.\n- Multiple instances of graphs being kept in memory when processed on save.\n- Fixed pressing delete on an empty graph adding unnecessary command.\n- Inheriting from another Node will correctly display the inherited Blackboard Variables.\n- Fixed Graph Editor title blocking interaction with Open and Debug buttons.\n- Crashes on Domain reload caused by OnAssetsSave().\n- Fixed asset name in graph editor not updating when asset name changed on disc.\n- Fixed newly created Conditions not being automatically added to the selected Conditional node.\n- Fixed RepeatWhile node behaving like a do while.\n- Conditions not getting copied properly when a conditional node was duplicated.\n- Fixed navigation nodes sometimes stalling after being called successively.\n- Fixed click events going through to elements underneath search menu items.\n\n### Known Issues\n- Clearing a node field, saving and reverting the asset in source control does not restore the field value.\n- PlayParticleSystem internal pooling does not support runtime deserialization."},"unity":"6000.0","upmCi":{"footprint":"89788cb2984010fa52ceba18ab38a343ce7cc47d"},"samples":[{"path":"Samples~/Example","description":"A simple Behavior
