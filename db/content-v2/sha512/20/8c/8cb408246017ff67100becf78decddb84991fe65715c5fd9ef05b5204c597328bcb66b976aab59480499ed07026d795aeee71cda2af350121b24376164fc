These are all internal helper classes that shouldn't have been part of the public API in the first place.\n* Many APIs and types inside `ReliableUtility` have been made internal (among them all APIs and types dealing with send/receive contexts and packet information and timers). The information they contain was meant purely for internal consumption in the first place. The statistics and RTT information inside the shared context remains public.\n* Removed `errorCode` from `ReliableUtility.SharedContext`. Any useful information it can provide is already returned by higher-level APIs like `NetworkDriver.EndSend`.\n* Default send and receive queue sizes are now set to 512 packets (previous value was 64). The queue sizes are modifiable with `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkConfigParameters`.\n\n### Fixes\n* Fixed a possible exception in `IPCNetworkInterface` if it was fed an unknown endpoint.\n* Fixed `NetworkDriver.GetLocalEndpoint` when using `WebSocketNetworkInterface` (note that on web browsers this will now print a warning since local endpoints are not available on WebGL)."},"type":"asset","unity":"2022.2","upmCi":{"footprint":"c45ffcc2bb06b4280f5bc8a908302b1be03a1eea"},"samples":[{"path":"Samples~/CrossPlay","description":"Example of how to use MultiNetworkDriver to create a server that accepts both UDP and WebSocket connections.","displayName":"Cross-play Example"},{"path":"Samples~/JobifiedClientServer","description":"Very simple client and server implementations using jobs.

The functionality still works and will remain supported for version 1.X of the package, but will be removed in version 2.0, where pipeline buffer sizing is handled internally.\n* Updated Burst dependency to 1.6.6.\n* Updated Collections dependency to 1.2.4.\n* Updated Mathematics dependency to 1.2.6.\n\n### Fixes\n* `BeginSend` would not return an error if called on a closed connection before the next `ScheduleUpdate` call.\n* Fixed a warning if using the default maximum payload size with DTLS.\n* Removed an error log when receiving messages on a closed DTLS connection (this scenario is common if there were in-flight messages at the moment of disconnection).\n* Fix broken link in package documentation."},"type":"asset","_from":"file:/tmp/com.unity.transport@1.1.0-gr88mv2k.tgz","unity":"2020.3","upmCi":{"footprint":"cd3960b74c34568953deb592a44e23402c3a914c"},"samples":[{"path":"Samples~/CustomNetworkInterface","description":"Shows how to build a custom network interface using the INetworkInterface API","displayName":"Custom Network Interface"},{"path":"Samples~/Ping","description":"Several samples on the basics of jobs, mainthread setups using the Unity Transport","displayName":"Ping/Pong Sample"},{"path":"Samples~/Pipeline","description":"Shows how to use Pipeline stages","displayName":"Pipelines Sample"},{"path":"Samples~/RelayPing","description":"Basic sample on how to use Unity Relay with Unity Transport, your project must depend on com.unity.services.relay","displayName":"Unity Relay with Unity Transport"},{"path":"Samples~/Soaker","description":"Shows how to use pipelines and jobs to gather stats and create traffic using Unity Transport","displayName":"Soak Sample"}],"_resolved":"/tmp/com.unity.transport@1.1.0-gr88mv2k.tgz","_integrity":"sha512-PaI3pP+QTM53SarmWDmmMjKry4NtY437MBVxzWGjy4Xg0Tzmn/XJ5Ca0KftjIcBVsGBkYrO9hsxrebl6cj5z6Q==","repository":{"url":"https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.transport.git","type":"git","revision":"ce258b46039e4d4937778aa8d02c6532b9ea0888"},"_npmVersion":"7.5.2","_nodeVersion":"12.22.5","unityRelease":"0f1","name":"com.unity.transport","version":"1.1.0","displayName":"Unity Transport","description":"Unity network transport layer - the low-level interface for sending UDP data","dependencies":{"com.unity.burst":"1.6.6","com.unity.collections":"1.2.4","com.unity.mathematics":"1.2.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"78a14616d9579d75ac659b1f112bd2e78aa7ad88","tarball":"https://download.packages.unity.com/com.unity.transport/-/com.unity.transport-1.1.0.tgz"}},"1.0.0":{"_id":"com.unity.transport@1.0.0","upm":{"changelog":"### Changes\n* Changed version to 1.0.0."},"type":"asset","_from":"file:/tmp/com.unity.transport@1.0.0-z7tfhqrp.tgz","unity":"2020.3","upmCi":{"footprint":"38407b6505436c019e602001e0267b831314df13"},"samples":[{"path":"Samples~/CustomNetworkInterface","description":"Shows how to build a custom network interface using the INetworkInterface API","displayName":"Custom Network Interface"},{"path":"Samples~/Ping","description":"Several samples on the basics of jobs, mainthread setups using the Unity Transport","displayName":"Ping/Pong Sample"},{"path":"Samples~/Pipeline","description":"Shows how to use Pipeline stages","displayName":"Pipelines Sample"},{"path":"Samples~/RelayPing","description":"Basic sample on how to use Unity Relay with Unity Transport, your project must depend on com.unity.services.relay","displayName":"Unity Relay with Unity Transport"},{"path":"Samples~/Soaker","description":"Shows how to use pipelines and jobs to gather stats and create traffic using Unity Transport","displayName":"Soak Sample"}],"_resolved":"/tmp/com.unity.transport@1.0.0-z7tfhqrp.tgz","_integrity":"sha512-xze119WhEVkjUrTx3VmsJiD39WlDHbM+iiVd2sxk0LBoKH/XnJQlthojk/x7hRmOjLenD+mxZ2dfD5Q95Pt/kQ==","repository":{"url":"https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.transport.git","type":"git","revision":"6a2ab2aed4ceaaef42b07fdcae1a89d0e09014a4"},"_npmVersion":"7.5.2","_nodeVersion":"12.21.0","unityRelease":"0f1","name":"com.unity.transport","version":"1.0.0","displayName":"Unity Transport","description":"Unity network transport layer - the low-level interface for sending UDP data","dependencies":{"com.unity.burst":"1.6.4","com.unity.collections":"1.2.3","com.unity.mathematics":"1.2.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"979b0379b9f473fb9669d0bdbcac1f3d9a08f1a5","tarball":"https://download.packages.unity.com/com.unity.transport/-/com.unity.transport-1.0.0.tgz"}},"1.0.0-pre.16":{"_id":"com.unity.transport@1.0.0-pre.16","upm":{"changelog":"### Changes\n* Don't warn when overwriting settings in `NetworkSettings` (e.g. when calling the same `WithFooParameters` method twice).\n* Added new methods to set security parameters: `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithSecureServerParameters`.

Once pong is received the client\nwill disconnect.\n\nIt is a simple example showing you how to use the new Unity Transport Package.\nPing consists of multiple scenes, all found in `sampleproject/Assets/Scenes/`.\n\n- `PingMainThread.unity` - A main-thread only implementation of ping.\n- `Ping.unity` - A fully jobified version of the ping client and server.\n- `PingClient.unity` - The same jobified client code as `Ping.unity`, but without the server.\n- `PingServer.unity` - The dedicated server version of the jobified ping. A headless (or Server Build in 2019.1) Linux 64 bit build of this scene is what should be deployed to Multiplay.\n- `PingECS.unity` - An ECS version of the jobified ping sample.\n\n## Soaker\nA stress test which will create a set number of clients and a server in the same process. Each client will send messages at the specified rate with the specified size and measure statistics.\n\n## Pipeline\nAn example of the pipelines feature that offers layers of functionality on top of the default socket implementation behaviour.\n","_resolved":"","_integrity":"","repository":{"url":"https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.transport.git","type":"git","revision":"1f7f8fbd9096f7b13cfb7a21d3ed15ae16b48a5b"},"_npmVersion":"6.13.4","_nodeVersion":"12.16.1","unityRelease":"0f1","readmeFilename":"README.md","name":"com.unity.transport","version":"1.0.0-pre.2","displayName":"Unity Transport","description":"Unity network transport layer -
