Note that this fix is temporarily applied to the Code Coverage package and will be moved to the [Coverage API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TestTools.Coverage.html) in the engine in the future.,### Changes,- Updated Report Generator to version 4.8.13,- Renamed *assemblyFilters* aliases in [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html); `<user>` was renamed to `<assets>` and `<project>` was renamed to `<all>`.,### Improvements,- The size of the coverage result files and the Code Coverage session duration have been optimized. When more than one coverage xml result files are generated within a Code Coverage session, these files now include only the coverage data of the visited lines. Then, at the end of the session a final coverage xml result file is generated which includes all the lines but with zero coverage.,- Added Help IconButton in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html),- Refactored the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) UI to include a new *Report Options* section and removing the word 'Generate' from options,- Introduced new selection buttons under the *Included Assemblies* dropdown in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html); use the *All* button to select all the assemblies in the project. Use the *Assets* button to select only the assemblies under the `Assets` folder. Use the *Packages* button to select only the Packages' assemblies. If searching, the buttons will apply only to the assemblies visible in the list.,- Added [What's new](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/whats-new.html) and [Upgrade guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/upgrade-guide.html) pages in the documentation,- Added [Using relative paths in path filters](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html#using-relative-paths-in-path-filters) section in documentation,- Updated documentation to match version 1.2.0-exp.6,### Features,- Added `Test Runner References` coverage report option in the [Code Coverage window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CodeCoverageWindow.html) which if checked generates references to tests allowing viewing coverage per test. Note that this option affects Test Runner Coverage sessions only.,- Added `generateTestReferences` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html) which allows viewing coverage per test,- Added `pathFiltersFromFile` in *-coverageOptions* for [batchmode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2/manual/CoverageBatchmode.html) which allows specifying an external file which contains a list of path filters. When this file contains relative paths, the `sourcePaths` option can be used to specify the source directories.,- When the `pathFilters` option in *-coverageOptions* contains relative paths, the `sourcePaths` option can be used to specify the source directories."},"type":"asset","_from":"file:/tmp/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2.0-exp.6-azn5di10.tgz","unity":"2019.3","upmCi":{"footprint":"eae0d644f27a0afee313ebec1a5e0c52c762938f"},"samples":[{"path":"Samples~/Tutorial","description":"The Code Coverage Tutorial will give you an insight into what Code Coverage is and how you can identify areas of your code that need more testing, even if you haven't written any automated tests.","displayName":"Code Coverage Tutorial"}],"_resolved":"/tmp/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@1.2.0-exp.6-azn5di10.tgz","_integrity":"sha512-AKDvXmkK6zV6zzh4c0OSKbQLZulZcNIJ2LcuQieuSgdikh/6MTDFhjh0MYAIUMQ24690ta267DT6/keraj2fzw==","repository":{"url":"https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage.git","type":"git","revision":"507e353e0fdf438085cf03dadf50f3ea26c888ee"},"_npmVersion":"7.5.2","_nodeVersion":"12.21.0","unityRelease":"0a8","relatedPackages":{"com.unity.testtools.codecoverage.tests":"1.2.0-exp.6"},"name":"com.unity.testtools.codecoverage","version":"1.2.0-exp.6","displayName":"Code Coverage","description":"Use this package to export code coverage data and reports from your automated tests.

Code Coverage currently supports **EditMode** and **PlayMode** tests. It also allows you to track the code coverage changes through time.\n\nAdditionally, the Code Coverage package offers a **Coverage Recording** feature which allows capturing coverage data on demand.\n\nThe Code Coverage package is available as a preview package via the Package Manager for Unity 2019.3 and above. Please make sure to enable preview packages in the Package Manager, otherwise it won't be listed.\n\nFor more information see the [Code Coverage package documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@latest).\n\n![ReleaseBadge](https://badges.cds.internal.unity3d.com/packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage/candidates-badge.svg) ![ReleaseBadge](https://badges.cds.internal.unity3d.com/packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage/release-badge.svg)\n","_npmUser":{"name":"service-airflow-production@unity","email":"packman-ops+service-airflow-production@unity3d.com"},"_resolved":"","_integrity":"","repository":{"url":"git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage.git","type":"git","revision":"9f85eb154ceb7f4020b6a2fee77a0746447ee546"},"_npmVersion":"6.12.1","_nodeVersion":"12.13.1","unityRelease":"0a8","readmeFilename":"README.md","relatedPackages":{"com.unity.testtools.codecoverage.tests":"0.2.1-preview"},"name":"com.unity.testtools.codecoverage","version":"0.2.1-preview","displayName":"Code Coverage","description":"Use this package to export code coverage data and reports from your tests.","keywords":["test","coverage","testing","opencover"],"dependencies":{"com.unity.test-framework":"1.0.16"},"dist":{"shasum":"9784108cca95130500820365e718dd3090622c65","tarball":"https://download.packages.unity.com/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage/-/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage-0.2.1-preview.tgz"}},"0.2.0-preview":{"_id":"com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@0.2.0-preview","type":"asset","unity":"2019.3","scripts":{},"repository":{"url":"git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage.git","type":"git","revision":"ff907058304bc965d2b0619cd291e8d23ff0cdbb"},"unityRelease":"0a8","relatedPackages":{"com.unity.testtools.codecoverage.tests":"0.2.0-preview"},"name":"com.unity.testtools.codecoverage","version":"0.2.0-preview","displayName":"Code Coverage","description":"Use this package to export code coverage data and reports from your tests.","keywords":["test","coverage","testing","opencover"],"dependencies":{"com.unity.test-framework":"1.0.16"},"dist":{"shasum":"f9b56eca1fd58aa1ca8522e7e27a707cdfe17ccc","tarball":"https://download.packages.unity.com/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage/-/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage-0.2.0-preview.tgz"}}},"time":{"1.2.6":"2024-07-26T10:16:30.000Z","1.2.5":"2023-12-20T10:13:34.000Z","1.2.4":"2023-06-01T13:38:30.000Z","1.2.3":"2023-04-13T10:37:27.000Z","1.2.2":"2022-11-22T11:53:01.000Z","1.2.1":"2022-10-28T13:21:58.000Z","1.2.0":"2022-08-24T13:33:35.000Z","1.2.0-exp.7":"2022-03-24T20:54:15.000Z","1.2.0-exp.6":"2022-03-18T11:51:51.000Z","1.1.1":"2021-12-20T10:27:31.000Z","1.2.0-exp.5":"2021-10-26T21:06:00.000Z","1.2.0-exp.4":"2021-09-28T10:44:54.000Z","1.2.0-exp.3":"2021-09-17T17:57:15.000Z","1.2.0-exp.2":"2021-08-31T20:06:24.000Z","1.2.0-exp.1":"2021-08-27T20:54:59.000Z","1.0.1":"2021-06-16T21:45:13.000Z","1.1.0":"2021-06-10T18:42:06.000Z","1.0.0":"2021-03-10T22:40:31.000Z","1.0.0-pre.4":"2021-02-26T14:57:57.000Z","0.4.3-preview":"2021-02-26T14:41:46.000Z","1.0.0-pre.3":"2021-01-21T12:10:59.000Z","0.4.2-preview":"2021-01-21T12:05:59.000Z","1.0.0-pre.2":"2021-01-13T11:33:01.000Z","0.4.1-preview":"2021-01-12T17:35:20.000Z","1.0.0-pre.1":"2020-11-19T15:17:46.000Z","0.4.0-preview":"2020-11-12T08:22:36.000Z","0.3.1-preview":"2020-08-03T15:33:56.000Z","0.3.0-preview":"2020-05-20T23:21:29.000Z","0.2.3-preview":"2020-02-25T16:05:51.000Z","0.2.2-preview":"2019-12-12T16:37:06.000Z","0.2.1-preview":"2019-12-05T21:04:08.000Z","0.2.0-preview":"2019-11-13T21:05:50.000Z"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.6"},"etag":"\"1c3b2-DUvVvwwWcq44WxDn7+5Zs4xhWK0\""}
