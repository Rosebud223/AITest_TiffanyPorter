The same input bindings will work the same as before.\n- The HandVisualizer sample meshes has been updated.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where OpenXR would incorrectly report joints as having updated when they weren't actually tracked that frame. `XRHandSubsystem`'s `trackingAcquired` and `trackingLost`, as well as `XRHand.isTracked`, will now work as expected.\n- Fixed lifetime of `GameObject`s in `HandVisualizer` sample.\n- Reinstated the validation rule that the Meta Touch Interaction Profile is required in the OpenXR Interaction Profiles list."},"type":"asset","unity":"2020.3","upmCi":{"footprint":"a6896e67deea26da7d88c810111383043e248c42"},"samples":[{"path":"Samples~/HandVisualizer","description":"Basic sample showing how visualize hands.","displayName":"HandVisualizer"}],"repository":{"url":"https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.xr.hands.git","type":"git","revision":"4b522cb7297b444be543fad211b01a2f105c9330"},"documentationUrl":"https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.hands@1.1/manual/index.html","name":"com.unity.xr.hands","version":"1.1.0-pre.3","displayName":"XR Hands","description":"Surfaces the cross-platform subsystem API for hand-tracking.
