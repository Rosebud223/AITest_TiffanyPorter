Selecting this setting will still generate a test signed package as before however the package will now only be installed into the local Microsoft Store when using 'Build and Run'. This change makes it possible to generate a test signed package without it being installed automatically by using 'Build'. This is more appropriate for CI environments.\n- `GdkSettingsAsset.createScriptingDefine` is now marked as obsolete, please do not use. Changing this field will no longer take effect. The creation of `MICROSOFT_GDK_SETTINGS` is now controlled by 'Build for GDK'.\n- The 'Build for GDK' setting now automatically adds or removes the `MICROSOFT_GDK_SUPPORT` pre-processor.\n- Changing the state of 'Build for GDK' will now prompt for a domain reload as this is required for the `MICROSOFT_GDK_SUPPORT` pre-processor change to take immediate effect.\n- Pre-existing GdkSettingsAssets which have previously disabled `Build for GDK` on platforms that can only support GDK may find this setting disabled and unchecked. To re-enable the GdkSettingsAsset may need to be re-created.\n- The Windows Standalone post-process now deploys the `.DLLs` located in the `Plugins/GDK` folder when `Build for GDK` is enabled (automatically imported DLLs will be marked Editor only by default). \n\n### Removed\n- The UI for 'Define MICROSOFT_GDK_SUPPORT' has been removed, this pre-processor is now added or removed based on 'Build for GDK'  \n\n### Known Issues\n-"},"unity":"2021.3","license":"Unity Companion Package License v1.0","hideInEditor":false,"documentationUrl":"https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.microsoft.gdk.tools@1.3/manual/index.html","name":"com.unity.microsoft.gdk.tools","version":"1.3.0","displayName":"Microsoft GDK Tools","description":"This package adds GDK workflow support when used in combination with com.unity.microsoft.gdk","dependencies":{"com.unity.ugui":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"e48c14414059dbb8d94c353225ca23c65acd53da","tarball":"https://download.packages.unity.com/com.unity.microsoft.gdk.tools/-/com.unity.microsoft.gdk.tools-1.3.0.tgz"}},"1.2.3":{"_upm":{"changelog":"### Added\n- Added documentation on creating and publishing an app to Microsoft Partner Center.\n- When building for GDK, invalid Microsoft Game Config will throw an exception.\n- Added new status and actions log messages on Microsoft Game Config.\n- Added Microsoft Game Config Identity properties Name, Publisher, and Version to `GameConfigAsset`.\n- Add an info box when `Create Microsoft Store Package` is enabled to warn about Shell Visuals requirement\n\n### Fixed\n- Building GDK for Windows using `Create Visual Studio Solution` and GDK Settings' `Create Microsoft Store Package` is now working.\n- makepri.exe fails to build game config localized resources when Windows Driver Framework is installed.\n- `MakePri.exe` Game Config localization build can fail when using BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer due to incorrect usage of `GetBuildLocation()`.\n- Create/OpenKey Access denied error on Windows 11.\n\n### Changed\n- Marked `GameConfigAsset` properties as obsolete, do not use to set values.
